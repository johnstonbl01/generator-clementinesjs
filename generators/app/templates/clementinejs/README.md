# Clementine.js MEAN Boilerplate

**Note**: Clementine.js is currently being transitioned to a Yeoman generator and has not yet been published. The installation steps below will not work at this time.

## Overview

Clementine.js is a lightweight MEAN stack boilerplate intended for beginners and advanced users alike. The Standard boilerplate includes a few more bells and whistles to improve workflow, but remains a simple boilerplate without much fluff to get in the way. 

This version of the boilerplate contains a website that demonstrates the power of the stack, including some examples of how to apply Angular & data-binding using MEAN.

## Versions

- [Bare](https://github.com/johnstonbl01/clementinejs-bare): A stripped down version of the boilerplate for quick prototyping
- [FCC](https://github.com/johnstonbl01/clementinejs-fcc): An extension of the beginner version that includes authentication & authorization
