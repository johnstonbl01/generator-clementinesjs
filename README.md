# Deprecation

Heya! :wave: This package is being deprecated & moved to another repository for a new version of Clementine in early 2020. I'll link to the repo when that happens, but this repository will be archived at that time

# Clementine.js Yeoman Generator

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/johnstonbl01/clementinejs](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/johnstonbl01/clementinejs?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

A [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) generator for the [Clementine.js boilerplate](https://github.com/johnstonbl01/clementinejs).

Clementine.js is a lightweight boilerplate for fullstack JavaScript development which utilizes MongoDB, Express and Node.js. Coming in at just under 32 KB, Clementine.js is a perfect alternative to more feature-dense boilerplates.

Clementine.js errs on the side of transparency and simplicity, making it an ideal starting point for beginner and seasoned developers alike. Note that this implementation assumes the developer wishes to perform implementation of more complex features him- or herself.

## Installation

**Prerequisites**:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [NPM](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/)

**Installation**:

```bash
$ npm install -g yo
$ npm install -g generator-clementinejs
$ mkdir your-project
$ cd your-project
$ yo clementinejs
```

To install the Angular version of Clementine.js, use `$ yo clementinejs:angular` instead of `$ yo clementinejs`.

_Note_: Both the generator and Yeoman must be installed globally.

To start the application, browse to the project directory and type: `$ node server` into the terminal window. Point a browser to `localhost:3000` and you're up and running!
