# Clementine.js Yeoman Generator

A [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) generator for the [Clementine.js boilerplate](https://github.com/johnstonbl01/clementinejs).

Clementine.js is a lightweight boilerplate for fullstack JavaScript development which utilizes MongoDB, Express and Node.js. Coming in at just under 32 KB, Clementine.js is a perfect alternative to more feature-dense boilerplates.

Clementine.js errs on the side of transparency and simplicity, making it an ideal starting point for beginner and seasoned developers alike. Note that this implementation assumes the developer wishes to perform implementation of more complex features him- or herself.

## Installation

**Prerequisites**:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
